Most of the people there are unmotivated and underachievers.  Everyone that works there complains about how little they are paid yet very few take the steps to leave.  As an initial job it ok cause you learn a lot and are exposed to various areas.  But if you stay more then 2 years you get very comfortable it becomes hard to leave.  The place changes you for the worst.,Its is boring and you do not use your brain,They should realize that they are never going to keep any talent there.  They need to change the way things are because a person who works really hard and the person that does the bear minimum are treated pretty much the same.
