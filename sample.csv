Accountabilities expand on an ongoing basis, which can be good for one’s resume (but they won’t compensate you for it).","Revenue not growing so shareholder returns are coming largely from staff cuts, compensation cuts and benefit cuts. 

Culture has significantly degraded last few years. Policy is to rate 10 percent of employee Below Expectations and manage them out, and good managers who have built high-performing teams still have to find people to rate BE and to eliminate on a rolling basis. Think Lord of the Flies.

Bad behavior among EC tolerated to a much greater degree than it used to be or is in a good company. 

EC has become increasingly dysfunctional in recent years, with almost everyone using their jobs as stepping stones vs. building sustainable value for the company. EC member responsible for our group badmouthed most of his own people.

Long-time employees not presently valued, and most long careers there end on an ugly note.

HR poorly resourced and run. Former employees should expect to spend lots of time fighting for everything they’ve earned.",Start caring about your employees again. You still have many terrific people who are working their backsides off. Don’t throw them away like you’ve been doing.
